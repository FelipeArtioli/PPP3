# PPP3 Exercises Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to exercises and drills from "Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++ (3rd Edition)" by Bjarne Stroustrup. My goal is to document my learning journey and provide examples that may help other beginners.
> All exercises are implemented according to my understanding; multiple valid approaches exist.
> Code includes comments explaining the reasoning behind each solution.
## Structure

Each chapter has its own folder containing the source code for exercises.
> Since I have skipped a few, I'll later justified that in a list of all exercises.
