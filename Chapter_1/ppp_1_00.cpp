// PPP - Chapter 1 - Exercise 0

#include <iostream>
// This tells the compiler to include the input/output stream library.
using namespace std;
// This lets us use standard library features like 'cout' without having to
// write 'std::cout' every time. I've heard this is a bad practice, but I'll use
// this to keep the style similar to the book.

int main() {
  // 'main' is the entry point of every C++ program.
  // The program starts running from here.

  cout << "Hello, World!" << '\n';
  // 'cout' stands for "character output". It prints text to the screen.
}
// When the program finishes running 'main', it ends.

// Compile and run the “Hello, World!” program. An IDE will have a
// compile-and-run button. Even something as simple as “Hello,
// World!” very rarely compiles and runs in a first attempt to use a new
// programming language or a new programming environment.
