#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

    cout << "Hello, World!" << '\n';

}

// Compile and run the “Hello, World!” program. An IDE will have a
// compile-and-run button. Even something as simple as “Hello,
// World!” very rarely compiles and runs in a first attempt to use a new
// programming language or a new programming environment.
