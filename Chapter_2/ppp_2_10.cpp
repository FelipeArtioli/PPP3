// Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and
// outputs the result. For example:
// + 100 3.14
// * 45
// Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement
// to figure out which operation the user wants, for example, if
// (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables of type double.
// Implement this for operations called +, âˆ’, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div
// with their obvious meanings.
